.. _known-issues:

Known issues
==============
 
	• AMD Vitis™ GUI projects on RHEL83 and CEntOS82 may fail because of a lib conflict in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting. You need to remove ${env_var:LD_LIBRARY_PATH} from the project environment settings for the function to build successfully.
	• rgbir2bayer, isppipeline_rgbir PL functions are not supplied with input images.
	• lkdensepyroptflow fails to meet timing when URAM is enabled.
	• Filter2D, YUY2-Filter2D, Threshold AIE-ML functions will fail to compile in 2024.1 Vitis due to a known compiler issue. You need to use 2023.1 version Vitis and platform for these functions.
