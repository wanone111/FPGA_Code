2020.1
----

AMD Vitis |trade| HPC Library release 2020.1 introduces HLS primitives, pre-built kernels and software APIs for several HPC applications on FPGAs. These applications are: 

* 2D Acoustic RTM (Reverse Time Migration) based on FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain) algorithm, including forward kernel and backward kernel

* MLP (Mult-Layer Perceptron) and its components including common activation functions and fully connected network kernels
